Client
---
You can use the client class as an instance, 
within a class or by subclassing. 
The general usage flow is as follows:

*Create a client instance
*Connect to a broker using one of the connect*() functions
*Call one of the loop*() functions to maintain network traffic flow with the broker
*Use subscribe() to subscribe to a topic and receive messages
*Use publish() to publish messages to the broker
*Use disconnect() to disconnect from the broker

Callbacks will be called to allow the application to process events as necessary.
